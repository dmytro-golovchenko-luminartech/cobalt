# Cobalt Version Changelog

This document records all notable changes made to Cobalt since the last release.

## Version 10

### AutoMem - Memory Configuration
AutoMem has been added which assists developers in tuning the memory
settings of the Cobalt app. On startup, memory settings are now printed
for all builds except gold. Memory settings can be altered via the
command line, build files and in some instances the Starboard API.
