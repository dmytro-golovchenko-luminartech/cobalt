Cobalt Webdriver-driven Benchmarks
---------------------

This directory contains a set of webdriver-driven benchmarks
for Cobalt.

Each file should contain a set of tests in Python "unittest" format.

All tests in all of the files in this directory will be run on the build system.
Results can be recorded in the build results database.

To run an individual test, simply execute a script directly (or run
all of them via "all.py"). Platform configuration will be inferred from
the environment if set. Otherwise, it must be specified via commandline
parameters.

To make a new test:

 1. If appropriate, create a new file borrowing the boilerplate from
    an existing simple file, such as "shelf.py"

 2. If this file contains internal names or details, consider adding it
    to the "EXCLUDE.FILES" list.

 3. Use the `record_result*` methods in the `tv_testcase.TvTestCase` base
    class where appropriate.

 4. Results must be added to the build results database schema. See
    the internal "README-Updating-Result-Schema.md" file
