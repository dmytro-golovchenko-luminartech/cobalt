    Fallback fonts are chosen based on a match: full BCP-47 language tag
    including script, then just language, and finally order (the first font
    containing the glyph). Order of appearance is also the tiebreaker for weight
    matching.

    NOTE: When the optional family attribute "fallback" is included for a
    family, then it dictates whether or not that family is added to the fallback
    list. However, when it is not included, then the lack of a "name" attribute
    causes the family to be added to the fallback list.

    The pages attribute indicates which character pages are contained within
    the font. It is used with character fallback to allow the system to quickly
    determine that a character cannot appear in a font without requiring the
    full character map to be loaded into memory. Character pages are zero
    indexed, and each page contains 256 characters, so character 1000 would be
    contained within page 3.
